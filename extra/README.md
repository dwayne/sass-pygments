# Extra Styles

This directory contains extra styles not included by default in Pygments.

To convert these styles you will need to copy them to the `./path/to/site-packages/pygments/styles` directory and then run the script as stated in the top-level README.

## solarized.py

This style is taken from https://github.com/john2x/solarized-pygment. It is based on the light version of [Solarized](https://github.com/altercation/solarized).
